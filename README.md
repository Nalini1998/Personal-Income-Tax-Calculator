# Income Tax Calculator

This is a simple web app that helps users calculate their personal income tax (PIT) and monthly salary based on their gross salary, number of dependants, employment type and whether they have lived in their country of residence for 183 days or more. 

The app takes in user input via a web form, which prompts the user to provide their gross salary, number of dependants, employment type and residence status. 

The app calculates the social insurance, taxable income, personal deductions, tax, and net take-home pay based on the user's input and displays the results in an HTML table.
